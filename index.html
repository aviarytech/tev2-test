    <strong>Definition:</strong>
      Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. They have emerged as a pivotal standard, endorsed by the W3C, fostering interoperability and promoting a decentralized approach to digital identity verification. This model facilitates a secure and verifiable method of establishing digital trust, allowing individuals and entities to have greater control and transparency over their digital identities.

      The Terminology Engine V2 (TEv2) is a project under eSSIF-Lab, encompassing a set of specifications and tools aimed at facilitating the creation, maintenance, and application of terminologies across various types of publications including websites and whitepapers. It supports different formats such as HTML and LaTeX, aligning with diverse individual scopes. Furthermore, it provides terminological aid for authors working on documentation, specifications, whitepapers, and similar materials. Initially, it served as a testing ground for the CTWG Toolkit development.

    <strong>Term:</strong> Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
  </div>
  <div class="glossary-definition">
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
      Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital credentials, created to represent information found in physical credentials, such as a passport or license, as well as information that has no physical equivalent like ownership of a bank account[[23](source)]. They are defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a standard data model and representation format for expressing cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials[[24](source)]. A VC uses cryptographic proofs to bind an issuer statement about a subject to the subject&#x27;s identifier, and the resulting document can contain claims relative to the subject. In some instances, proofs of different kinds can be bundled together within a VC[[25](source)].
